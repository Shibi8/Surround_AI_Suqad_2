# Features of Surround

**The features of Surround framework include:**

1. Surround framework is predefined, and has structured and modular format of programming that makes understading easier to those who are new to programming.
2. Each task is performed in Pipeline fashion which makes it easier to understand the program and data flow.
3. Data can be easily manupulated and accessed around the project.
4. As the tasks are divided into stages, error handling is always focused on the particular stage rather than the entire project.
5. The config.yaml file is accessible via path defined and it is convenient to use throughout the project.
6. Since the project is shared on GitHub, the data or code reusability is high.
7. The example 2 i.e., Apple Share Price Prediction is implemented in this framework and it helps Data Scientists to predict the future prices without any hustle.

**With benefits there will always be some drawbacks. Identified are listed below:**

1. Plotting a graph or chart is a bit difficult, so as the project progresses we have to focus on that.
2. Necessity of use of operate function in every class is yet to be clarified.

**_Note_:** The document is based on the initial research and has to be redefined as the Project progresses.
