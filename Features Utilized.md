# Features Utilized of Surround:

### 1.	Modular Programming:

Division of a program/class into sub-classes and testing separately makes it easy to read, maintain and rely upon. Minimization of dependencies is the goal. When creating a modular system, several modules are built separately and more or less independently. The executable application will be created by putting them together. every file, which has the file extension .py and consists of proper Python code, can be seen or is a module! There is no special syntax required to make such a file a module. A module can contain arbitrary objects, for example files, classes or attributes. All those objects can be accessed after an import.

### 2.	Re-usability of code (Stages)
i.	Same code can be used in other code to perform specific functionality. 

### 3.	Easier Access to Data (Surround Data Class)
i.	Explain
ii.	Code snippets

### 4.	Surround(): creates Pipeline
i.	Explain

### 5.	Config.yaml can be configured in the start for the whole project, Global variable, methods
